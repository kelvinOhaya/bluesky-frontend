Next Steps:

--------BACKEND--------
Features that need looking at again:
 - changing group chat names
 - changing group profile pictures
 - clearing the state after changing user profile pictures

 OPTIONAL
 - Find a way to speed up the change profilePicture functions, they seem a little slow. Only optional because you'll probably end up doing this anyway.


--------FRONTEND--------
Features that need looking at again
- Overlay component doesn't take up whole screen on smaller screen sizes
- Settings Gear Icon is either whited out or offscreen on smaller screens (could be an issue with the spacing between the UserLabel and members)
