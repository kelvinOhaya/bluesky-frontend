How to give live updates

Frontend:
1: Send a delete request to the "leave-room" endpoint, including the current room ID 

Express/Mongoose(Backend):
2: Upon receiving the request, find the room with the matching current room id from the client, and remove the user's ID from the member's array, and add it to the exMember's array 

Frontend:
3: Send a socket event to the backend called "leave-room", including the current room ID

Socket (Backend):
4: Use Mongoose to find the room that matches the room ID that was sent from the client
5: Store the length of the member's array in a variable, and send an event called "update-member-count" to all the members of the room, including the variable it was stored in and the current room Id again
6: Leave the room using socket.leave()

Frontend:
7: Upon receiving updateMember count, use the room id from the event to find the room, and update the member count variable to the new value in ChatRooms. Do the same for currentChat if it is open
